Game Name: "Stranded Horizons"

Game Overview:
In Stranded Horizons, players find themselves stranded on a deserted island or an alien planet. The main objective is to survive by working together to gather resources, build shelter, hunt for food, and defend against a variety of threats. The game combines survival mechanics, resource management, and teamwork, with ever-evolving environmental challenges to keep the gameplay dynamic and engaging.

Gameplay Mechanics:
Character Creation:

Players can create and customize their avatars with various appearance options, choosing different skills or professions (e.g., builder, scout, medic, engineer).

Each player has a set of attributes (e.g., stamina, strength, agility, intelligence), which will affect their survival abilities.

Resource Gathering:

The island or planet is rich in natural resources such as wood, stone, minerals, plants, and animals. Players must gather these resources to craft tools, weapons, and build shelters.

Resources are finite, and players must manage them carefully to avoid depletion.

Players will need to explore the environment to discover hidden resources or secret areas.

Crafting System:

A detailed crafting system will allow players to create a wide variety of items, from simple tools (axes, fishing rods) to complex machinery (traps, generators, medical supplies).

Crafting will require players to combine different resources they collect. For example, to make a shelter, players may need wood, stone, and rope, and to build more advanced gear, rare resources might be required.

Shelter Building:

Players can build a temporary shelter at the beginning, but as they progress, they will be able to construct more advanced and fortified bases, using upgraded materials.

Shelters are essential for protection from wildlife, weather conditions, and hostile forces. They also provide a safe haven where players can rest and store supplies.

Bases can be expanded with various defensive structures (walls, traps, watchtowers).

Hunting & Gathering:

To survive, players need to hunt animals (or alien creatures, depending on the setting) for food, craft weapons, and gather edible plants.

Hunting will require strategy, stealth, and cooperation, as some creatures may be too dangerous for solo players to handle.

Players can also plant crops or set up sustainable food sources if resources allow.

Weather System:

The game will feature a dynamic weather system, affecting gameplay in real-time. Rain can make the ground muddy, preventing movement; storms can damage shelters or make it harder to find food.

Extreme temperatures or environmental hazards (like radiation, toxic gas, etc.) will force players to adapt by crafting specific gear or seeking shelter.

Some resources will only be available during specific weather conditions (e.g., certain plants only grow in rain).

Dynamic AI Enemies:

Players will face various threats, such as aggressive wildlife (or alien creatures), hostile survivors, or environmental hazards.

Enemies will have different behaviors, requiring players to adapt and work together to defend against them.

Combat can range from simple melee to crafting complex traps or ranged weapons. Players must also decide whether to go on the offensive or avoid combat.

Teamwork & Communication:

Players will need to communicate and cooperate to survive. Certain tasks will require multiple players to complete, such as building complex structures or defending against a large enemy threat.

Cooperative activities, like setting up traps or building a water collection system, require good coordination.

Players can also share or trade resources, so helping each other out is essential for long-term survival.

Progression & Difficulty:

The game has different difficulty levels, where the challenges (resource scarcity, enemy strength, weather conditions) scale up.

As players progress, they unlock more advanced technologies and better equipment.

New challenges and locations open up as players complete certain milestones (e.g., building a radio to communicate with the outside world or finding an escape route).

Game Modes:
Survival Mode:

Players aim to survive as long as possible. The game ends when the entire group perishes, or they manage to escape (if the game has an escape objective).

Story Mode:

A narrative-driven mode where players uncover the mysteries of the island or planet, solving puzzles, discovering ancient ruins, and unlocking secrets of the environment.

The story could involve uncovering the reason for the crash/stranding and how to escape the environment, with hidden story elements and side quests.

Endurance Mode:

A more hardcore version of survival mode where resources are even more limited, and the weather/environment is harsher. Players must rely on their wits, teamwork, and advanced skills to survive for as long as possible.

Multiplayer Features:
Cooperative Multiplayer: Players can join forces with friends or strangers. Teams of up to 4-8 players (depending on server settings) can work together to survive.

PvP Option: While the game primarily focuses on cooperation, there could be a PvP element where players can choose to turn against each other in certain conditions or over resources.

Voice and Text Communication: Players can communicate via voice chat or text, enhancing the cooperative aspect.

Monetization Ideas:
Cosmetic Items: Skins for characters, unique outfits, and customizations for shelters and gear.

DLC Expansions: New locations, environments, or story arcs to keep the game fresh and engaging.

Seasonal Events: Limited-time events or challenges with exclusive rewards.

Visual & Audio Design:
Art Style: Realistic with a stylized touch, focusing on immersion while keeping the game accessible. The environment can range from lush jungles to barren wastelands or alien landscapes.

Sound Design: Atmospheric sounds, from the rustling of leaves to the distant growl of creatures, will heighten tension. Music can be dynamic, with calming tracks for exploration and intense music for combat or disasters.
