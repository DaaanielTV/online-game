# Online Game Code & Development Guidelines

This document provides a comprehensive overview of our coding best practices along with detailed game design information for the development of our online game, "Stranded Horizons". Follow these guidelines to ensure code consistency, maintainability, and clarity across our projects.

## 1. Code Formatting & Best Practices

### General Guidelines
- **Clear and Consistent Formatting:**
    - Use uniform indentations, spacing, and styling across all files.
    - Include 3 to 5 descriptive comments per code block or on significant lines for clarity.

## 2. Frontend Development

### HTML Best Practices
- **Semantic Markup:**
    - Utilize semantic HTML5 elements to enhance accessibility and SEO.
    - **Example:**
        ```html
        <!-- Header section with primary navigation and branding -->
        <header>
                <!-- Logo with alternative text for accessibility -->
                <img src="logo.png" alt="Company Logo">
        </header>
        ```

- **Accessibility:**
    - Include alt text, titles, and ARIA labels where appropriate.
    - Maintain a proper document structure using heading hierarchy (h1-h6).

### CSS Best Practices
- **Organized & Modular Styles:**
    - Prefer external stylesheets to maintain modularity.
    - Comment key sections to explain design decisions.
    - **Example:**
        ```css
        /* Main container: uses flexbox for vertical alignment */
        .container {
                display: flex;              /* Align elements using flexbox */
                flex-direction: column;     /* Stack elements vertically */
                justify-content: center;    /* Center elements vertically */
        }
        ```

- **Responsive Design:**
    - Use media queries for device-specific styling.
    - Consider BEM naming conventions for clarity.

### JavaScript & Backend Development
- **Clean and Commented Code:**
    - Write concise JavaScript with proper variable scoping.
    - Use descriptive comments, especially for complex logic.
    - **Example:**
        ```javascript
        // Application Module: Encapsulate to avoid global scope pollution
        (function() {
                // Fetch and process user data from the API
                async function fetchUserData() {
                        try {
                                // Execute HTTP request using fetch method
                                const response = await fetch('/api/user');
                                // Parse JSON response
                                const data = await response.json();
                                console.log(data);  // Debug log
                        } catch (error) {
                                console.error('Error fetching user data:', error);
                        }
                }
                fetchUserData();  // Initialize user data
        })();
        ```

- **Secure Database Integration:**
    - Use prepared statements and parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
    - Separate database logic from application logic using MVC or similar patterns.
    - Archive deprecated queries and thoroughly document schema changes.
